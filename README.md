There’s a Better Way to Download Files
While the way we outlined is simple and straightforward, it’s most optimal for simply viewing the code files, not experimenting. If you’re planning on downloading GitHub files to experiment with, the best way would be to “fork” the project. A fork is simply your own copy of a repository.

Forking a repository comes with a number of benefits. It gives you your own copy on your GitHub account, which allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. For example, you could find a bug in my Tip Calculator or want to add your own features. So, you could “fork” my Tip Calculator, creating a copy on your GitHub account. Here, you could mess around with the code and experiment with it without affecting the original project because this would be your copy or “fork.” 

Most commonly, forks are used to propose changes to someone else’s project, like fixing a bug or adding a feature, as we mentioned.
